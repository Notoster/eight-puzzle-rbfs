README
======
The code has been implemented in Java. Attached file contains the source, dependency jars, executable jar for this assignment etc.  

Execution
=========

There are three possible ways to run the submitted JAR file:

a) java -jar <path_to_input_file_containing_the_initial_state>

If only the initial state file is given as the input, it will by default consider the following goal state:

0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8

b) java -jar <path_to_input_file_containing_the_initial_state> <path_to_input_file_containing_the_goal_state>

Here we get both initial state and goal state as input from files. We can use this if the goal state is something different from the above default state.

c) java -jar <path_to_input_file_containing_the_initial_state> <path_to_input_file_containing_the_goal_state> <board_size>

where board size specifies the dimensions of the board. (Example: 3 means it is a 3 X 3 board) 

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
====================
If the depth reaches 500 or more the program will exit.

QUESTION
========
Implement a Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) to determine a solution for the 8-puzzle problem given an input initial state. The 8-puzzle should be a 3x3 puzzle.

- The initial state of your program should be input from a text file with numbers in rows separated by a <tab> character. Each row of the input file should be terminated by a newline character.

- The empty square should be represented by the number 0

- Each move should be represented by one of the actions: up, down, left, or right to indicate which direct the empty tile moves. The result of an action will switch locations of the 0 tile with the tile in the direction of the move (i.e. if the empty tile moves up, the tile in that location will  move down to replace the old location of the 0 tile).

- The Goal State should have the empty tile in the upper left corner of the puzzle, e.g.
0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8

When a solution is discovered, your program should display the sequence of moves to arrive at the goal state from the given initial state. For example:
up
left
down
down
right
up
etc.
